#Write a minitest assertion that will fail if the value.odd? is not true

assert value.odd?, 'value is not odd'

#assert tests whether its first argument is truthy (that is, it is neither false nor nil).
# If the first argument is not truthy, the test fails, and the second argument is displayed as the failure message.
